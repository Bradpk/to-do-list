DESCRIPTION:
Create an online to-do list manager application.


MoSCoW:

Must Have: 
Dynamically render the content with React using components
Display all to-do list items
Three "views" for the user: All, Completed, & To-Do (not completed)
Cross out or check off one item as "completed"
See a count of remaining items
Remove one item (either hard delete or soft delete/archive)
Check off or cross out all items in one click as a "completed all" function
Ability to press a button and all checked off items become active again
Website must be responsive
Website must be styled
Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

Should Have: 
Remove all completed items (soft delete/archive)
Use LocalStorage to persist data on a revisit or reloading of the page. With this implementation add a useEffect hook to access localStorage.
Create a flow diagram for the front end architecture to be used in an MVP
Add a separate “Reminders” set of functionality

Could Have: 
Edit To-Do's inline with a doubleclick event that changes it from a rendered text to a text input.
Add due dates and alarms to the to-dos that handle pop ups in your browser in an elegant fashion
Automatically mark to-dos with a new status based on done/not done and the time it was due.
